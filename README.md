# Fruit-ninja-on-FPGA
We aim to create a fruit ninja that can run on THE DE-10 FPGA. The objective of the game is to earn points after destroying different types of fruits that appear from the bottom of the screen. The game will continue to proceed until the player misses three fruits or slices through a bomb which appears from the bottom of the screen. This game is a well known mobile game that has quite the popularity. We intend to add features in the development of the game in order to make the design to earn more difficulty points which will be discussed later. The slicer in the game will be navigated and controlled by the USB interface in which a wired keyboard will be used as the input to the MAX3421E USB. Overall, the keyboardâ€™s keycodes pressed will need to align with each fruit's matching keycode in order to destroy it, however, if the wrong keycode is pressed you will lose a life (3 lives in total). Additionally, if you pressed the keycode of a bomb then you will lose the game instantly ignoring the amount of lives you have.
